# BloxFlip-Kraken-Predictor
A  BloxFlip predictor that isn't pure rng. <br/>
This predictor works by using BloxFlip api calls to run in a sandbox <br/>
the highest amount of simulations your pc can handle (most likely about 15 millions) <br/>
to then determine the most likely outcome with an average success rate of 97.4%. <br/> 
 <br/>
*NOTE: in the SRC you will only find a basic version of the program that uses only one call <br/>
because we don't want this method to get patched with api ratelimiting. <br/>

# installation
